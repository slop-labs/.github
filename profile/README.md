# 🧪 Slop Labs

**The unincorporated, one-man R&D subsidiary of a certain financial technology organization.**

> *"Move fast and generate things."*

## What is this?

Slop Labs is where proof-of-concepts go to be born, validated, and occasionally abandoned in a blaze of token expenditure. Through relentless—and sometimes violent—prompting, we churn out rapid prototypes at the intersection of AI and "what if we just... automated that?"

This is not production code. This is the primordial soup from which production code may occasionally crawl.

## Research Areas

🤖 **AI Orchestration** — Multi-agent systems, agentic workflows, and teaching robots to manage other robots

🏗️ **Automated Code Planning & Development** — LLM-driven architecture, code generation pipelines, etc.

📊 **Underwriting Automation** — Because someone has to teach the machines to say "no" to loan applications

📅 **Resource Management Automation** — Calendars, tasks, and the eternal struggle against administrative chaos

🔬 **Deep Research Automation** — Automated synthesis of knowledge, or: "I asked Claude to read 47 PDFs so I wouldn't have to"

## Philosophy

1. **Prototype first, apologize later.** If it works, it's a feature. If it doesn't, it's a learning experience.
2. **Token limits are just suggestions.** (They are not. Our API bills confirm this.)
3. **Documentation is for closers.** And also for future-us who will have no idea what past-us was thinking.
